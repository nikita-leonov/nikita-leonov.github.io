It was intended to be a big-big post about tricks and tips of UINavigationBar and
UIToolbar customization. Fortunately Iâ€™ve found an ultimate solution for these two
components which is actually two lines of code one of which is an import of a framework:

{% highlight objc %}
#import <QuartzCore/QuartzCore.h>
navigationBar.layer.contents = (id)backgroundImage.CGImage;
{% endhighlight %}
