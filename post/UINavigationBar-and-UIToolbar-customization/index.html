<p>It was intended to be a big-big post about tricks and tips of UINavigationBar and UIToolbar customization. Fortunately Iâ€™ve found an ultimate solution for these two components which is actually two lines of code one of which is an import of a framework:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='cp'>#import &lt;QuartzCore/QuartzCore.h&gt;</span>
<span class='n'>navigationBar</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='n'>layer</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='n'>contents</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='p'>(</span><span class='kt'>id</span><span class='p'>)</span><span class='n'>backgroundImage</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='n'>CGImage</span><span class='p'>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
